                <p>
                    Snakeout is a game in which a team of loyalists is
                    infiltrated by a group of snakes. The loyalists must try to
                    figure out who the snakes are, and the snakes must try to
                    keep the loyalists from figuring out their identity. The
                    game is separated into five missions. The first team to
                    "win" three missions wins the game.

                    In my opinion, the easiest way to learn how to play Snakeout
                    would be to watch someone else play, as it will help you get
                    a feel for the dynamic of the game. Here's a video from
                    Tabletop on YouTube of some people playing The Resistance:

                    <b>How it works</b>
                </div>
                <p>Here's a rundown of a round of Snakeout:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Start a new game, and give the code to your friends to
                        join.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When everyone has joined in, anyone may start the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each player can now view their role: either loyalist or
                        snake.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The loyalists don't know who the snakes are, but
                                the snakes are told who the other snakes are.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next, a randomly selected captain will select a certain
                        number of players to go on the mission.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If the captain is a loyalist, they should try to
                                select players who they believe are not snakes
                                to go on the mission.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The captain may also select themselves to go on
                                the mission.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the captain submits their selection, everyone will
                        be prompted to vote on the captain's selection of
                        players for the mission.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Loyalists will want to approve mission teams of
                                people who they believe to be loyalists. They
                                will want to keep snakes off the team, because
                                it takes just one snake to fail the mission
                                altogether.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Be advised that game will show everyone each
                                person's vote on the results page.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The vote results are then displayed based on majority
                        vote.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If the majority votes to reject the team, a new
                                captain will be selected at random and the
                                process will start over again.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the vote is a tie, the selection will be
                                rejected.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the selection is approved, the mission
                                commences.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        During the mission, the players selected to go on the
                        mission will get to choose to either pass or fail the
                        mission.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If one or more players vote to fail the mission,
                                it will fail.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Again, everyone on the mission must vote to pass
                                it for it to pass, with one exception detailed
                                below.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                NOTE: If the game has seven or more players and
                                it is the fourth mission, TWO or more players
                                must vote to fail the mission for it to fail.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you are a loyalist, it will always be in
                                their best interest to pass the mission. Again,
                                although the game will allow it, do not fail the
                                mission as a loyalist, because it just hurts
                                your team.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you are a snake, although it will sometimes
                                be in your best interest to fail the mission,
                                other times you may want to pass the mission to
                                throw the other players off their scent.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The results of the mission will then be displayed on
                        screen.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Unlike the results screen of the player vote,
                                the mission results screen does not show how
                                players voted (e.g. Pass or Fail).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It does, however, show how many pass and fail
                                votes there were.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                For example, if a mission has two players on it,
                                and one player votes pass, and the other votes
                                fail, the other players will now know that one
                                of the two of you is a snake.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The game will now continue to the next mission, starting
                        over the process of picking a random captain and having
                        them select players.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once either team, loyalists or snakes, has gotten 3
                        missions, they win the game. To clarify:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Once 3 missions are passed, the loyalists win.
                            </li>
                            <li>Once 3 missions fail, the snakes win.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When a team is declared winner, the snakes that round
                        are displayed on the screen for public scrutiny.

                        Don't worry if someone disconnects in the middle of the

                        to replace the disconnected player, and the game will
